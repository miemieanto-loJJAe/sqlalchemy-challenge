In the pricipiataion analysis, the graph showed that generally, rainfall increased significantly between summer and fall, and during spring. Seeing that it increased in spring didn't surprise me (I'm sure "April showers bring May flowers" still applies in Hawaii in some way), but seeing the increase in September was a surprise. 

In the station analysis, it appears that mid 70's had the frequency of recurrence. That make sense since Hawaii truly only has two seasons and is generally warm so seeing that doesn't shock me too much.
